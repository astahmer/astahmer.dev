import VirtualColorSimpleExample from '@/components/examples/virtual-color-simple.astro'

It's another question that I see a lot, a bit different than
[the previous one.](/posts/how-does-xxx-compares-to-panda-css)

The previous question was more about comparing two solutions _(what does Panda has that `xxx` doesn't and vice-versa)_.
Since I wanted this question to be fair from both sides by anyone debating on the topic, and as I am pretty
knowledgeable with Panda; I mostly wrote about Panda's
[**limitations**](/posts/how-does-xxx-compares-to-panda-css#and-why-not-panda-css), their reasons and some workarounds.

This time, I feel like this question is more about what **strengths** Panda has to offer. And I've got a tons of answers
for that !

So, from the endless list of styling solutions and [`CSS-in-JS`](#css-in-js) libraries, why should you choose Panda?

## Build-time CSS

Panda CSS uses [`static analysis`](#static-analysis) on your code to generate CSS. This means that we look at the code
you wrote (source files) and generate CSS from it.

This is a huge advantage over `runtime` styling solutions, not only because it's **faster** (no need to compute/inject
style at runtime, on each render, which could cause style recalculations for the browser), but also because it means
that we can a generate a raw CSS file that you can use (and cache !) **anywhere**.

## Atomic CSS

Also sometimes called `utility-first`, this is a very popular way of writing CSS.

The idea is to write 1 CSS class per CSS property, and then compose them together. This leads to a small optimized CSS
file, since most of the time you'll reuse the same CSS classes.

```css
@layer utilities {
  .p_22px {
    padding: 22px;
  }

  .fs_2xl {
    font-size: var(--font-sizes-2xl);
  }

  .text_center {
    text-align: center;
  }
}
```

## Type-safety

Panda CSS leverages `TypeScript` to provide type-safety.

This means that you'll get autocompletion, type-checking and you'll be yelled at if you do something wrong. ‚ö†Ô∏è

This also means that you don't need a VSCode extension to get autocompletion, it's **built-in**. _(tho, we've been
working on a VSCode extension that provides **super-powered autocompletion and even more features**)_

```tsx {7} "blue.300" "2xl" "123px" "_hover" "&:focus"
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function App() {
  return (
    <div
      className={css({
        color: 'blue.300', // will show every possible colors from your theme
        padding: "2xl" // and this will only show the spacing tokens (shared with margin and other properties)
        width: '123px', // you can also use raw CSS values

        _hover: { color: 'blue.500' }, // and conditions from your config
        "&:focus": { color: 'green.500' }, // or even arbitrary CSS selectors
      })}
    >
      Hello World
    </div>
  )
}
```

Note: By default, [`config.strictTokens`](https://panda-css.com/docs/references/config#stricttokens) is set to `false`
and that means you'll get autocompletions from your [`config.theme`](https://panda-css.com/docs/references/config#theme)
**but you'll also be able to use any CSS value.**

If you set [`config.strictTokens`](https://panda-css.com/docs/references/config#stricttokens) to `true`, you'll only be
able to use `tokens` that are included in your `config`, unless using the escape-hatch syntax `[xxx]`:

```tsx del={9} ins={10} "2xl" "[14px]"
// using config.strictTokens: true
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function App() {
  return (
    <div
      className={css({
        fontSize: '2xl', // ‚úÖ is a valid token
        fontSize: '14px', // ‚ùå TS will throw an error because "14px" is not a token
        fontSize: '[14px]', // ‚úÖ using escape-hatch syntax for arbitrary values
      })}
    >
      Hello World
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Batteries included

### Built-in presets

We provide 2 different [presets](https://panda-css.com/docs/customization/presets) out of the box (you don't need to
install anything):

- `@pandacss/preset-base`, which contains the default
  [conditions](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/conditional-styles) /
  [utilities](https://panda-css.com/docs/utilities/background) /
  [patterns](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/patterns)
- `@pandacss/preset-panda`, which contains the [default theme](https://panda-css.com/docs/customization/theme)
  _(keyframes / breakpoints / tokens / textStyles)_

If those presets don't fit your needs, you can always set
[`config.eject`](https://panda-css.com/docs/references/config#eject) to `true` to remove them and
[start from scratch with a minimal setup](https://panda-css.com/docs/guides/minimal-setup).

You can also [create your own presets](https://panda-css.com/docs/customization/presets) and share them with the
community !

### No additional tooling

Since Panda is based on `Typescript`, you don't _need_ to install any VSCode extension to get autocompletion (and inline
documentation from [MDN](https://github.com/mdn/data) through [`csstype`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csstype)), it's
built-in.

Prettier just works, it's just functions and objects.

Merging styles ? [Covered.](#merging-styles) Recipes (cva) ? [Gotcha.](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/recipes)

## Extendable

### Theming

I mentioned the ability to create your own presets, but of course you can also just customize your `panda.config.ts`
with your [theme](https://panda-css.com/docs/customization/theme) _(keyframes / breakpoints / tokens / textStyles)_ /
[conditions](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/conditional-styles) /
[utilities](https://panda-css.com/docs/utilities/background) / [patterns](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/patterns)
to fit your needs.

Using the `extend` keyword inside of any of those config options will allow you to add your own customizations on top of
the default presets (and any other that you added).

Everything will be deep merged, that means keys with the same name will be merged together, arrays will be concatenated,
etc.

### Outdir

Panda CSS is very flexible and can be used in many different ways. That's partly because we're using a
[codegen step](https://panda-css.com/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) that allows us to generate a `style-system`
tailored to your needs.

- Let's say you don't like [`shorthands`](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/writing-styles#shorthand-properties) ? Set
  [`config.shorthands`](https://panda-css.com/docs/references/config#shorthands) to `false` and they won't be allowed
  anymore.

- Stricter [type-safety](#type-safety) ? Set
  [`config.strictTokens`](https://panda-css.com/docs/references/config#stricttokens) to `true`

- Too many properties suggested in the
  [`styled` factory](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/style-props#factory-function) and
  [`JSX patterns`](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/style-props#jsx-patterns) ? Set
  [`config.jsxStyleProps`](https://panda-css.com/docs/references/config#jsxstyleprops) to `minimal` (that only allows
  the `css` special property) or `none` to disable them completely.

- Need to change the `@layer` names ? Set [`config.layers`](https://panda-css.com/docs/references/config#layers) to
  whatever you need. (Can be useful to avoid naming conflicts with other styling libraries !)

### CSS generation

You can also customize the way we generate CSS, like which
[`separator`](https://panda-css.com/docs/references/config#separator) should be used in the generated class names, or
[`config.prefix`](https://panda-css.com/docs/references/config#prefix) to add a prefix to all your class names.

We also include a [CSS reset](https://panda-css.com/docs/references/config#preflight) by default, but you can disable it
with [`config.preflight`](https://panda-css.com/docs/references/config#preflight) set to `false`.

### Config

You can see the full list of config options here: https://panda-css.com/docs/references/config

## CSS-in-JS

Ever since [the rise of CSS-in-JS](https://npmtrends.com/@emotion/css-vs-styled-components)
([thanks](https://blog.vjeux.com/2014/javascript/react-css-in-js-nationjs.html) to [@vjeux](https://twitter.com/Vjeux)
!), there's been a lot of debates about it. Some people love it, some people hate it.

I personally love it, I think it just makes sense to have your whole UI component in one place, markup **AND styling**.
This is basically the idea of colocation taken to the next level.

Well, actually with Panda it's not really `CSS-in-JS`, it's more like `CSS-in-TS` since we've got
[type-safety](#type-safety) all over the place.

And that works with most JSX-like frameworks, like [React](https://panda-css.com/docs/installation/nextjs) /
[Preact](https://panda-css.com/docs/installation/preact) / [Svelte](https://panda-css.com/docs/installation/svelte) /
[Vue](https://panda-css.com/docs/installation/vue) / [Solid](https://panda-css.com/docs/installation/solidjs) /
[Qwik](https://panda-css.com/docs/installation/qwik)

### RSC compatible

Panda CSS is compatible with React Server Components
([RSC](<(https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-server-components)>)),
you don't need to do anything special, after all we're just generating CSS at `build-time`. üòÅ

## Style props

Not only you can use the `css` function inside your components file to style them, but you can also use any
[JSX props](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/style-props#using-style-props) that
[matches either a CSS property name, `shorthand` or a `utility`](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/style-props#property-renaming)
defined in your config (or from a `preset`).

```tsx {15-20}
import { css } from 'styled-system/css'
import { styled } from 'styled-system/jsx'

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <div
      className={css({
        display: 'flex',
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
        h: 'full',
      })}
    >
      <styled.button
        rounded="md"
        fontWeight="semibold"
        height="10"
        px="4"
        bg={{ base: 'yellow.500', _dark: 'yellow.300' }}
        color={{ base: 'white', _dark: 'gray.800' }}
      >
        Button
      </styled.button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Merging styles

### css()

For example, you can just pass multiple arguments to the `css` function, and they'll be merged together.

```tsx {7-8}
import { css } from 'styled-system/css'

css({ display: 'flex', bg: 'color.500' }, { bg: 'red.500', color: 'white' })
// would result in { display: 'flex', bg: 'red.500', color: 'white' }
```

### raw()

This can be especially useful with the `.raw()` function, available on `css` / `recipes` / `patterns`.

This `raw` function will return what you passed in (or transform the object for `patterns`), and **serves as a marker
for the `static analysis`**, to tell the Panda `extractor` that you're creating a `style object` and we should generate
the CSS for it.

```ts del={4-5} ins={7-8}
// file-1.ts
import { css } from 'styled-system/css'

export const base = { display: 'flex', bg: 'color.500' }
// ‚ùå this will not generate any CSS

export const base = css.raw({ display: 'flex', bg: 'color.500' })
// ‚úÖ this will generate CSS as expected
```

```ts
// file-2.ts
import { css } from 'styled-system/css'
import { base } from './file-1'

export const styles = css.raw(base, { bg: 'red.500', color: 'white' })
// ‚úÖ would result in { display: 'flex', bg: 'red.500', color: 'white' }
```

### cx

You can also use the `cx` function to merge multiple class names together.

```tsx {7-8}
import { css, cx } from 'styled-system/css'
const className = cx(css({ display: 'flex', bg: 'color.500' }), 'my-class')
// would result in something like 'd_flex text_color_500 my-class'
```

More examples are available [here](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/writing-styles#merging-styles)

## Multi-Theme tokens

You can use custom [`conditions`](#conditions) to create
[multi-theme tokens](https://panda-css.com/docs/guides/multiple-themes), and since you can nest them, you can create as
many combinations as you want.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="demo">
<MultiTokensExample />
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="conditions.ts">

```tsx
export default {
  light: '[data-color-mode=light] &',
  dark: '[data-color-mode=dark] &',
  pinkTheme: '[data-theme=pink] &',
  blueTheme: '[data-theme=blue] &',
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="semantic-tokens.ts">

```tsx
import { defineSemanticTokens } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineSemanticTokens.colors({
  // ...
  text: {
    value: {
      _pinkTheme: { base: '{colors.pink.500}', _dark: '{colors.pink.300}' },
      _blueTheme: { base: '{colors.blue.500}', _dark: '{colors.blue.300}' },
    },
  },
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="app.ts">

```tsx
<div data-theme="pink" data-color-mode="dark">
  <h4 className={css({ color: 'text' })}>Pink dark</h4>
</div>
<div data-theme="blue" data-color-mode="dark">
  <h4 className={css({ color: 'text' })}>Blue dark</h4>
</div>

<div data-theme="pink" data-color-mode="light">
  <h4 className={css({ color: 'text' })}>Pink light</h4>
</div>
<div data-theme="blue" data-color-mode="light">
  <h4 className={css({ color: 'text' })}>Blue light</h4>
</div>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Since Panda is based on CSS variables, that also means you can override the `data-theme` at runtime, and it will
automatically update the colors. You could even replace the theme colors by overriding the current CSS variables with a
`style={xxx}` attribute, useful for example if you want to let your users customize the colors.

---

## Virtual color palette

One of the most powerful feature, yet not very well known, is the ability to create a
[virtual color palette](https://panda-css.com/docs/guides/virtual-color) from your tokens.

This allows you to refer to a dynamic color by its shade (50 to 900 in the built-in preset)
[or its semantic name](https://panda-css.com/docs/guides/virtual-color#semantic-virtual-colors), and it will
automatically resolve to the current color palette.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="demo">
  <VirtualColorSimpleExample />
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="color-palette.ts">

```tsx
import { css, cva, cx } from '../styled-system/css'

const button = cva({
  base: {
    padding: 4,
    // you can also specify a default colorPalette in the `base` recipe key
    // colorPalette: 'blue',
    // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  },
  variants: {
    variant: {
      primary: {
        bg: { base: 'colorPalette.500', _dark: 'colorPalette.200' },
        color: { base: 'white', _dark: 'gray.900' },
      },
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: { variant: 'primary' },
})

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <div className="light">
        <button className={cx(css({ colorPalette: 'blue' }), button())}>Click me</button>
        <button className={cx(css({ colorPalette: 'green' }), button())}>Click me</button>
        <button className={cx(css({ colorPalette: 'red' }), button())}>Click me</button>
      </div>
      <div className="dark">
        <button className={cx(css({ colorPalette: 'blue' }), button())}>Click me</button>
        <button className={cx(css({ colorPalette: 'green' }), button())}>Click me</button>
        <button className={cx(css({ colorPalette: 'red' }), button())}>Click me</button>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Multi-theme color palette

Combined with custom [`conditions`](#conditions), you can create a multi-theme color palette that can also handle color
modes (light/dark), statically. I went a bit crazy with this next example, but it shows the power of Panda CSS.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="multi-theme-demo">
  <VirtualColorExample />

<TabItem label="panda.config.ts">

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  conditions: {
    extend: {
      mainTheme: '[data-theme=main] &',
      secondaryTheme: '[data-theme=secondary] &',
    },
  },
  theme: {
    extend: {
      semanticTokens: {

        <span className={css({ p: 4, display: 'inline-block', w: '120px' })}>Dark mode</span>
        <button className={css(button.raw({ variant: 'shades' }), { colorPalette: 'button' })}>Shades</button>
        <button className={css(button.raw({ variant: 'info' }), { colorPalette: 'button' })}>Info</button>
        <button className={css(button.raw({ variant: 'warning' }), { colorPalette: 'button' })}>Warning</button>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that you could duplicate that `button` object in the `semanticTokens` and just change the color values to get
another color palette, with the same nested semantic names, reacting to the same conditions.

e.g you could name it `alert` and have `alert.info` / `alert.warning` / `alert.warning.accent` /
`alert.warning.accent.secondary` all able to handle `light` / `dark` color modes for both the `main` and `secondary`
theme.

## Composite values

You can also create composite values, like a `border` that would be composed of a `width`, `style` and a `color`.

```tsx
import { css } from 'styled-system/css'

css({ border: '2px solid token(colors.blue.300)' })

// is equivalent to
css({ borderWidth: '2px', borderStyle: 'solid', borderColor: 'blue.300' })
```

## Static generator

Panda analyzes your code to generate CSS, but it also provides a way to generate CSS from rules that you can provide in
the `config.staticCss` option. This is useful:

- when the static extractor can't find a style usage in your code (e.g. if you're using something too dynamic or a
  runtime-only value)
- [to get rid of the lightweight JS runtime](/posts/how-does-xxx-compares-to-panda-css#lightweight-js-runtime) entirely
  by directly using the generated CSS atomic classes
- to pre-generate the CSS for a [component library](#component-library)

https://panda-css.com/docs/guides/static

## Static analysis

### Pit of success

Given we want to generate a CSS file at `build-time`, we need to know what CSS to generate **before** running your app,
and that's where `static analysis` comes in: by scanning your **source files** and finding style usage in there.

I would not really say that `static analysis` is an intended feature, as it
[also introduces some limitations](<(/posts/how-does-xxx-compares-to-panda-css#static-limitations)>), but I feel like it
incidentally **forces you to write better code**, basically it acts like a
[**pit of success**](https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/).

Since you can't (easily/directly) use `runtime dynamic values`, you'll have to find a way to make it static, and that's
actually a good thing !

### Smart

In addition to that benefit, our static extractor
[is pretty smart](/posts/how-does-xxx-compares-to-panda-css#static-limitations), it can detect style usage in many
different ways to the point **where it doesn't seem static anymore**.

I'm pretty confident it's _one_ of the most advanced static extractor among `build-time` styling solutions !

## Dynamic styling

I just said that Panda CSS uses `static analysis` to generate CSS, but that doesn't mean you can't use
`runtime dynamic values` ! You just have to find a way to make it static.

TODO

More examples [here](https://panda-css.com/docs/guides/dynamic-styling)

## Modern

Panda uses modern CSS features like
[cascade layers (`@layer`)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer), CSS variables, modern selectors
like [`:where`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where) and
[`:is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:is) in generated styles.

Using the CSS `@layer`, there's no specificity war, for example your `utilities` style would always prevail on your
`recipes` style, since they're always applied in the right order.

```css
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

That being said, if you need to support older browsers you can always
[this `postcss` plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@csstools/postcss-cascade-layers) to polyfill the `@layer` syntax
and specifity.

## Usage

## Styling solution

This is the most common scenario, styling your appliction UI with Panda CSS.

While Panda brings many features to the table, you can choose to use a very small API surface, using only the `css`
function to style your components, and that's it.

Panda definitely brings some cool features for [`CSS-in-JS`](#css-in-js), but if that's not your thing, that's ok too.

Maybe colocation isn't your thing at all ? It's fine, you can keep your style objects in a separate file (`.css.ts` ?).

## Design-system / Component library

Panda comes with many tools for creating a `design system` or [component library](#component-library). :

Using the `panda.config` you can create a theme (`tokens` / `breakpoints` / `textStyles` / etc .. ) and even create your
own `utilities` / `conditions` / `patterns.` If needed, you can enforce type-safety by setting
[`config.strictTokens`](https://panda-css.com/docs/references/config#stricttokens) to `true`.

> The tokens (and semantic tokens) format is largely influenced by the
> [W3C Token Format](https://tr.designtokens.org/format/)

[Recipes](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/recipes) and
[slot recipes](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/slot-recipes) are a great way to style reusable components that can
be used in many different ways through their variants.

[Patterns](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/patterns) saves you from writing the same CSS or props over and over
again.

## Token generator

If you prefer writing raw CSS, you can still leverage Panda's token generator to generate CSS variables for each of your
`tokens`/`semantic tokens`.

https://panda-css.com/docs/overview/why-panda#token-generator

## Styling engine

Panda CSS being a styling engine, it's not tied to any framework or library, you can use it anywhere. You could even
build your own abstractions on top of it !

With the `@pandacss/node` package, you can have access to the same API as we use in the CLI and VSCode extension. The
`PandaContext` contains lots of useful methods, for example you can generate each `@layer` CSS independently, manipulate
the `TokenDictionary`, extract CSS from your code... You could
[create a bundler's plugin](/posts/how-does-xxx-compares-to-panda-css#why-not-a-bundler-plugin) with that, or you could
probably even create your own `extractor` and use it to generate CSS from your non-typescript code.

## Static Extractor

Speaking of the static `@pandacss/extractor`, it actually doesn't use any Panda-related code, its only dependency is
`ts-morph` (a wrapper around `typescript` parser). You could also use it to extract static values from any function or
JSX in your code.

## Developer experience (DX)

## Easy to learn

It's just the CSS you know already, using `camelCase` instead of `kebab-case`, with the additions of autosuggestions for
`tokens` and `conditions` and even raw values and selectors.

There's no need to learn a new syntax, no need to remember which class to use for whatever property, everything will
feel very familiar and intuitive, in addition to the autocompletion and type-safety built-in.

## Easy to use

Since all Panda does it generating a CSS, you can use it anywhere. ¬π

We also provide a `postcss` plugin to skip the CSS file import step and having another process (CLI with `--watch`) to
run in parallel.

While Panda brings many features to the table, you can choose to use a very small API surface, using only the `css`
function to style your components, and that's it. If you're not a fan of [`CSS-in-JS`](#css-in-js), that's ok too.

Maybe colocation isn't your thing at all ? It's fine, you can keep your style objects in a separate file. It _just
works_.

Getting started is as easy as installing the CLI and running the `panda` command in your project.

```sh
pnpm add -D @pandacss/dev
```

¬π. A real-world example : I'm not really familiar with Angular, but it seems to require a dedicated integration to work
with CSS-in-JS libraries. There's even [an issue opened](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25411) to get one
for Panda, but as the author mentioned, it's not really needed since you can just use the CLI + the generated CSS file.
Still, I can see the convenience !

## Easy to distribute

Panda can be distributed in different ways, depending on your needs.

### Preset

Using a preset is the easiest way to distribute your Design System (tokens, breakpoints, recipes, etc) with other Panda
users.

It's as simple as picking a few options from your `panda.config.ts`, creating a new `preset.ts` file and exporting those
options.

```ts
// preset.ts

import { definePreset } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const acmePreset = definePreset({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        colors: { primary: { value: 'blue.500' } },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

You can then publish it to npm and anyone can use it by installing it and adding it to their own `panda.config.ts` file.

```ts
// panda.config.ts

import { acmePreset } from '@acme-org/panda-preset'
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  presets: ['@pandacss/dev/presets', acmePreset],
  // don't forget to keep the built-in presets !
})
```

There are a few hand-picked presets listed in [EcoPanda](https://www.ecopanda.dev/presets), by
[Abraham](https://twitter.com/anubra266).

### CSS file

You can also distribute your library CSS by generating a static file using the CLI, and use it anywhere.

```sh
# generate the static CSS file
panda cssgen --outfile dist/styles.css
```

> This of course means that you shouldn't expose any Panda API (`css` / `recipes` / etc..) to your users because it
> would not generate any additional CSS.

### Component library

Panda allows you to create a component library, it could be intended for other Panda users or **for anyone**.

If you intend to distribute it to other Panda users:

- you should distribute a `preset` along with your components, so that your users can generate the CSS for your `tokens`
  / `recipes` / etc
- make a package dedicated to the `config.outdir` (defaults to `styled-system`, for this example we'll use
  `@acme/styled-system`)
- both you and your users **must** set your `config.importMap` to be the same as your outdir package name (
  `@acme/styled-system`)

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="@acme/preset">

```ts
// packages/preset/index.ts
import { definePreset } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default definePreset({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        colors: { primary: { value: 'blue.500' } },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="@acme/styled-system">

```ts
// packages/styled-system/panda.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'
import acmePreset from '@acme/panda-preset'

export default defineConfig({
  presets: [acmePreset],
  importMap: '@acme/styled-system',
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="webapp">

```ts
// apps/web/panda.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'
import acmePreset from '@acme/panda-preset'

export default defineConfig({
  presets: [acmePreset],
  importMap: '@acme/styled-system',
  include: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
})
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This is because:

1. Panda uses the `importMap` to know which imports should matching your theme (tokens / recipes / etc..)
2. by sharing the same module specifier (the right part of imports, e.g `abc` in `import xxx from 'abc'`), your bundler
   (`vite` for example) will be able to deduplicate the lightweight JS runtime (`config.outdir`) between the one from
   your library and the one from your users.

If you don't share the same module specifier, users will end up bundling the code for 2 different `css` functions, `cva`
etc.

- set your outdir package name (`@acme/styled-system`) as external in your build step so that you don't bundle it with
  your components, ex: `tsup src/index.tsx --external @acme-org/styled-system`

- you can expose any Panda API (`css` / `recipes` / etc..)

Summary:

1. publish a Panda `preset` so people can use your design system tokens
2. an outdir package (`@acme-org/styled-system`) so your users can override or extend your design system tokens
3. and of course your components (`@acme-org/components`) using the `@acme-org/styled-system`

---

If you intend to distribute it to anyone (not just Panda users), you probably just want to distribute a static CSS file
with your components, and that's it.

We have a documentation page related to this topic:
[component library](https://panda-css.com/docs/guides/component-library) and there are a few examples in
[this repository](https://github.com/astahmer/panda-monorepo-setup)

### Copy-paste

There's a recent trend of creating a component library and distributing it as a `copy-paste` solution.

For example, [Park UI](https://park-ui.com/) and [Shadow Panda](https://shadow-panda.dev/)
([`shadcn-ui`](https://ui.shadcn.com/) equivalent using Panda) are both component libraries that only rely on a `preset`
published on npm and then you can just pick the components you need and copy-paste them in your project.

## API examples

What better way to showcase what Panda CSS can do than with some concrete examples ?

## css

TODO

any token/semantic token/utility/css property/css var known value vs arbitrary known condition vs arbitrary merging raw
conditions eval return class list

## cx

just concatenate class names convenient

## cva

atomic recipe (cva) style by variants can still use anything like css generate atomic css raw
https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/recipes#atomic-recipe-or-cva
https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/recipes#should-i-use-atomic-or-config-recipes-

```ts
// badge.ts
export const badge = cva({
  base: {
